Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cristian. Programming has been a part of my journey since I was 14 years old. <br /> Starting with problems similar to those on leetcode to more creative ones (mazes, towers of hanoi, sorting, etc.).
<br /> It was rewarding to find the correct solution but I knew my design and creativity side were not contributing much to those problems. <br />

In highschool I discovered frontend development and was instantly hooked. Building visually appealing websites and using my creative side was enjoyable.
Soon after that the High School Diploma (Baccalaureate Exam) was aproaching and I had to abandon web development almost completely to focus on studying. <br />

I rediscovered my passion for frontend during my master's degree in Advanced Image Proccessing and now I'm having fun building projects and completing new courses. <br /> <br />
